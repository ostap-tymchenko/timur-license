### What is it?
This is a self made license that I am writing. 

### Why?
I found that releasing my work into the world brings me great anxiety. Someone may use my work  for military, or making guns or just things I don't want it to be used for.

This license is not open source. Instead it is a combination of a proprietary and open source license, depending on who you are.

Heres a handy chart:

A[What are you using the software for] --> B[Military, government*, coproration];
A --> C[Personal use]
C --Open source--> D["You are free to use it with acredidation and share-alike, but with restrictions"]
B --Proprietary--> E["you must receive a license, with restrictions"]
E --> F["there are usage restrictions that include not using the software for genocide or war, with specific carve outs."]
D --> F
```

### Things to consider:
- although for the most part this license does not allow it to be used for war, murder, genocide, and intentional beneficiaries of war cannot use the software protected by it, there is one intentional and large exception, which is the Ukrainian government. I am Ukrainian and very bias. If you do not want this, you are free to copy the license and remove that part.
